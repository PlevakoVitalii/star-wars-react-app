## Star-wars-react-app

![](https://github.com/PlevakoVitalii/star-wars-react-app/blob/master/readme-image.bmp)

Deployed todo-react-app here [Todo](https://plevakovitalii.github.io/star-wars-react-app/star-wars-react/).

- receiving data from the server or from a local file of your choice and storing it in a state;
- transition between pages without reloading;
- in the belief of the application, the output of the ramdom element from the data received from a remote source;
- lists of elements with the ability to select one to display data about it;
- type checking with PropTypes;
- access to data after authorization.

In this project I mastered:

- React
- react-create-app
- react-router-dom
- prop-types
- npm gh-pages

All components are in the `src` folder. All another files was generated by `react-create-app`

You can run this project locally just do:

- clone branch `review` with `git clone https://github.com/PlevakoVitalii/star-wars-react-app.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
